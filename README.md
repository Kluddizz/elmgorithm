# Elmgorithm
Browser based visualization of sorting algorithms using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

## Visualized algorithms
All of the visualized algorithms are implemented recursivly.

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

## How to start
Elmgorithm was developed using the interactive development tool `elm-reactor`.
You can download and start the app by executing the following commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Kluddizz/elmgorithm
$ cd elmgorithm
$ elm reactor
```
 This will start a local server (on port 8000 by default). Now, the app is accessible visiting `http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm`.

## How to use
### Overview

the input field.

### 2. Insert a number of elements
In the settings activate the input field 

### 3. Generate random elements
### 4. Calculate and play the animation
### 5. Watch the statistics and change the animation speed
